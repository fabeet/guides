# Laravel

- Use Laravel Fortify as the authentication backend implementation.
- Refer to [Laravel Coding Guidelines](https://www.mindtwo.de/guidelines/coding/laravel) for a more extensive explanation.

## Configuration

Configuration files must use kebab-case.

```
config/
  pdf-generator.php
```

Configuration keys must use snake_case.

```php
// config/pdf-generator.php
return [
    'chrome_path' => env('CHROME_PATH'),
];
```

Avoid using the `env` helper outside of configuration files. Create a configuration value from the `env` variable like above.

## Artisan commands

The names given to artisan commands should all be kebab-cased.

```bash
# Good
php artisan delete-old-records

# Bad
php artisan deleteOldRecords
```

A command should always give some feedback on what the result is. Minimally you should let the `handle` method spit out a comment at the end indicating that all went well.

```php
// in a Command
public function handle()
{
    // do some work

    $this->comment('All ok!');
}
```

If possible use a descriptive success message eg. `Old records deleted`.

## Routing

Public-facing urls must use kebab-case.

```
https://spatie.be/open-source
https://spatie.be/jobs/front-end-developer
```

Route names must use camelCase.

```php
Route::get('open-source', 'OpenSourceController@index')->name('openSource');
```

```html
<a href="{{ route('openSource') }}">
    Open Source
</a>
```

All routes have an http verb, that's why we like to put the verb first when defining a route. It makes a group of routes very readable. Any other route options should come after it.

```php
// good: all http verbs come first
Route::get('/', 'HomeController@index')->name('home');
Route::get('open-source', 'OpenSourceController@index')->name('openSource');

// bad: http verbs not easily scannable
Route::name('home')->get('/', 'HomeController@index');
Route::name('openSource')->get('OpenSourceController@index');
```

Route parameters should use camelCase.

```php
Route::get('news/{newsItem}', 'NewsItemsController@index');
```

A route url should not start with `/` unless the url would be an empty string.

```php
// good
Route::get('/', 'HomeController@index');
Route::get('open-source', 'OpenSourceController@index');

//bad
Route::get('', 'HomeController@index');
Route::get('/open-source', 'OpenSourceController@index');
```

## Controllers

Controllers that control a resource must use the plural resource name.

```php
class PostsController
{
    // ...
}
```

Try to keep controllers simple and stick to the default CRUD keywords (`index`, `create`, `store`, `show`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy`). Extract a new controller if you need other actions.

In the following example, we could have `PostsController@favorite`, and `PostsController@unfavorite`, or we could extract it to a separate `FavoritePostsController`.

```php
class PostsController
{
    public function create()
    {
        // ...
    }

    // ...

    public function favorite(Post $post)
    {
        request()->user()->favorites()->attach($post);

        return response(null, 200);
    }

    public function unfavorite(Post $post)
    {
        request()->user()->favorites()->detach($post);

        return response(null, 200);
    }
}
```

Here we fall back to default CRUD words, `store` and `destroy`.

```php
class FavoritePostsController
{
    public function store(Post $post)
    {
        request()->user()->favorites()->attach($post);

        return response(null, 200);
    }

    public function destroy(Post $post)
    {
        request()->user()->favorites()->detach($post);

        return response(null, 200);
    }
}
```

This is a loose guideline that doesn't need to be enforced.

## Views

View files must use camelCase.

```
resources/
  views/
    openSource.blade.php
```

```php
class OpenSourceController
{
    public function index() {
        return view('openSource');
    }
}
```

## Validation

When using multiple rules for one field in a form request, avoid using `|`, always use array notation. Using an array notation will make it easier to apply custom rule classes to a field.

```php
// good
public function rules()
{
    return [
        'email' => ['required', 'email'],
    ];
}

// bad
public function rules()
{
    return [
        'email' => 'required|email',
    ];
}
```


All custom validation rules must use snake_case:

```php
Validator::extend('organisation_type', function ($attribute, $value) {
    return OrganisationType::isValid($value);
});
```

## Blade Templates

Indent using four spaces.

```html
<a href="/open-source">
    Open Source
</a>
```

Don't add spaces after control structures.

```html
@if($condition)
    Something
@endif
```

## Authorization

Policies must use camelCase.

```php
Gate::define('editPost', function ($user, $post) {
    return $user->id == $post->user_id;
});
```

```html
@can('editPost', $post)
    <a href="{{ route('posts.edit', $post) }}">
        Edit
    </a>
@endcan
```

Try to name abilities using default CRUD words. One exception: replace `show` with `view`. A server shows a resource, a user views it.

## Translations

Translations must be rendered with the `__` function. We prefer using this over `@lang` in Blade views because `__` can be used in both Blade views and regular PHP code. Here's an example:

```php
<h2>{{ __('newsletter.form.title') }}</h2>

{!! __('newsletter.form.description') !!}
```

## Naming Classes

Naming things is often seen as one of the harder things in programming. That's why we've established some high level guidelines for naming classes.

### Controllers

Generally controllers are named by the plural form of their corresponding resource and a `Controller` suffix. This is to avoid naming collisions with models that are often equally named.

e.g. `UsersController` or `EventDaysController`

When writing non-resourceful controllers you might come across invokable controllers that perform a single action. These can be named by the action they perform again suffixed by `Controller`.

e.g. `PerformCleanupController`

### Resources (and transformers)

Both Eloquent resources and Fractal transformers are plural resources suffixed with `Resource` or `Transformer` accordingly. This is to avoid naming collisions with models.

### Jobs

A job's name should describe its action.

E.g. `CreateUser` or `PerformDatabaseCleanup`

### Events

Events will often be fired before or after the actual event. This should be very clear by the tense used in their name.

E.g. `ApprovingLoan` before the action is completed and `LoanApproved` after the action is completed.

### Listeners

Listeners will perform an action based on an incoming event. Their name should reflect that action with a `Listener` suffix. This might seem strange at first but will avoid naming collisions with jobs.

E.g. `SendInvitationMailListener`

### Commands

To avoid naming collisions we'll suffix commands with `Command`, so they are easiliy distinguisable from jobs.

e.g. `PublishScheduledPostsCommand`

### Mailables

Again to avoid naming collisions we'll suffix mailables with `Mail`, as they're often used to convey an event, action or question.

e.g. `AccountActivatedMail` or `NewEventMail`
