# Terminology

The language we use has power. Being as concise and descriptive as possible helps to lessen ambiguity. This leads to shared understanding and better outcomes.

## Terms

* Use `blocklist`, and not `blacklist`.*
* Use `allowlist`, and not `whitelist`.
* Don’t use black or white in a way that has a positive or negative connotation. Use only to describe the color of items (black text on a white background, change a color photo to black and white, the white point of your display). Use an alternative that’s appropriate to the context, such as deny, allow, unapproved, approved, or reject, accept.
* Avoid using `master` and `slave`.
	* For git, use `main`.
	* For databases, use `write database` and `read replica`.
	* For other scenarios, use terms such as `parent` and `child` or `leader` and `follower`. Be mindful of scenarios where other commands will create language like, sending `kill` signals to `children`.
* Use terms such as `excused` or `exempted` in place of `grandfathered`.
* Use `negative space`, and not `white space`.
* Use `billable hours`, and not `man hours`.
